# Sudoku-Solver-iOS-App
This iOS app takes a Sudoku puzzle as an input, and performs a backtracking search on the Constraint Satisfaction Problem. It can even solve the hard Sudoku problems!

This is actually a mini (1 day) project, which I completed in order to actively learn iOS / Swift 3. It's one of my first iOS apps.
